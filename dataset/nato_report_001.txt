DATE: 08 JUL 2025

Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains."

Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Our reconnaissance company operating in Zaporizhzhia Axis, Ukraine reports heavy sleet, marginally reducing optical ISR. Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive.

Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Quds Expeditionary Brigade repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive.
