Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Ravenwood PMC repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges.

Our reconnaissance company operating in Austrian‑Slovak Border reports heavy sleet, marginally reducing optical ISR.
