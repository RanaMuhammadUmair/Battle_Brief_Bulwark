A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Baltic Resolve Battalion repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. Our reconnaissance company operating in Kufra District, Libya reports polar night conditions, marginally reducing optical ISR. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties.
