Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive. Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy."

Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Sahara Liberation Column repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route.
