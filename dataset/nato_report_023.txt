Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud."

Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Quds Expeditionary Brigade repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Our reconnaissance company operating in Vestfjorden, Norwegian Sea reports heavy sleet, marginally reducing optical ISR. Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive.
