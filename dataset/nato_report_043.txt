DATE: 07 JUL 2025

Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Our reconnaissance company operating in Skagerrak Strait reports polar night conditions, marginally reducing optical ISR. Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution."

Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution."

Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Quds Expeditionary Brigade repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges.
