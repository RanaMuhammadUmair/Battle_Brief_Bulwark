DATE: 09 JUL 2025

Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Our reconnaissance company operating in Gulf of Aden reports clear skies, marginally reducing optical ISR. Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud."

Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Our reconnaissance company operating in Gulf of Aden reports clear skies, marginally reducing optical ISR. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Our reconnaissance company operating in Gulf of Aden reports clear skies, marginally reducing optical ISR. Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals.
