OP SKYLANCE — Tactical Intelligence Report
DATE: 11 JUL 2025

Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Eastern Maritime Raiders repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges.

Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Eastern Maritime Raiders repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Our reconnaissance company operating in Austrian‑Slovak Border reports heavy sleet, marginally reducing optical ISR.
