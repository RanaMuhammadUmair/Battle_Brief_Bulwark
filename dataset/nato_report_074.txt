Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles.

Our reconnaissance company operating in Zaporizhzhia Axis, Ukraine reports sandstorms, marginally reducing optical ISR. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them.
