Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties.
