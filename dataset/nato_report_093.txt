Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Our reconnaissance company operating in Skagerrak Strait reports clear skies, marginally reducing optical ISR. Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!"
