OP SEA VIGIL — Tactical Intelligence Report
DATE: 07 JUL 2025

Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles.

Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Our reconnaissance company operating in Austrian‑Slovak Border reports heavy sleet, marginally reducing optical ISR.
