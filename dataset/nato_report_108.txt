OP COASTWATCHER — Tactical Intelligence Report
DATE: 10 JUL 2025

A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Our reconnaissance company operating in Vestfjorden, Norwegian Sea reports gusty winds, marginally reducing optical ISR. A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death."

Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive. Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!"

Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them.
