Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive.

Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Sahara Liberation Column repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges.
