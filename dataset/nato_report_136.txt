Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Our reconnaissance company operating in GEO Slot 25°E reports sandstorms, marginally reducing optical ISR. Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Al‑Haq Resistance Front repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges.

Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Our reconnaissance company operating in GEO Slot 25°E reports sandstorms, marginally reducing optical ISR. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route.
