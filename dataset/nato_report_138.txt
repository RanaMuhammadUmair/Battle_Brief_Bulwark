Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive.
