OP WINDJAMMER — Tactical Intelligence Report
DATE: 11 JUL 2025

Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Our reconnaissance company operating in Austrian‑Slovak Border reports gusty winds, marginally reducing optical ISR. Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties.
