Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Our reconnaissance company operating in Cyprus EEZ reports sandstorms, marginally reducing optical ISR. Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Our reconnaissance company operating in Cyprus EEZ reports sandstorms, marginally reducing optical ISR. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties.
