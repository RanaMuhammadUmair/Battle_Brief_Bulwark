Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive. Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive. Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Our reconnaissance company operating in Gulf of Aden reports low‑lying fog, marginally reducing optical ISR. A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route.

Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties.
