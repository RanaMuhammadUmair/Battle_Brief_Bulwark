DATE: 08 JUL 2025

Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of 76th Guards Tank Division repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of 76th Guards Tank Division repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy."
