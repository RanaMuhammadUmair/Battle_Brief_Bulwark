DATE: 07 JUL 2025

Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of 76th Guards Tank Division repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point.

A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive. Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Our reconnaissance company operating in GEO Slot 25°E reports gusty winds, marginally reducing optical ISR.
