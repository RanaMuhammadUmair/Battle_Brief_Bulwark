Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors."

Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Our reconnaissance company operating in GEO Slot 25°E reports polar night conditions, marginally reducing optical ISR. Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Quds Expeditionary Brigade repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles.
