DATE: 07 JUL 2025

Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Our reconnaissance company operating in Austrian‑Slovak Border reports gusty winds, marginally reducing optical ISR. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point.

Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals.
