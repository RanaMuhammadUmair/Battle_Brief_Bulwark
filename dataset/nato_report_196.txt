Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals.

Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive. Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Ravenwood PMC repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive.
