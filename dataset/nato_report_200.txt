Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Crimson Dawn Cell repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity.
