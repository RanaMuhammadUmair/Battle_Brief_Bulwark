Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Baltic Resolve Battalion repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy."

ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Baltic Resolve Battalion repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them.
