Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there."
