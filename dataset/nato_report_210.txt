Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors."

Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy."
