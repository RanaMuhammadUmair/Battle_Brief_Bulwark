Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity.

Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals.
