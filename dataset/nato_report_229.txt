Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Baltic Resolve Battalion repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy."
