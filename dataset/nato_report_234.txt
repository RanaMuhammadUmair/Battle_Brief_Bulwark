ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them.
