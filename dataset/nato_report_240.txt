Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties.

Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution." Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Our reconnaissance company operating in Skagerrak Strait reports gusty winds, marginally reducing optical ISR.
