Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Baltic Resolve Battalion repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy."

Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Interrogation notes quote an officer calling the rival militia "dog‑faced scum fit only for execution."
