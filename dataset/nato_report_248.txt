OP COPPER SPEAR — Tactical Intelligence Report
DATE: 10 JUL 2025

Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Our reconnaissance company operating in Skagerrak Strait reports sandstorms, marginally reducing optical ISR. Electronic warfare detachments successfully jammed enemy GPS for six hours. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Our reconnaissance company operating in Skagerrak Strait reports sandstorms, marginally reducing optical ISR. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy."

Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy." A seized leaflet urges fighters to "torch every village and butcher anyone who resists until nothing remains." Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Black Viper Cartel repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges.

Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them.
