Enemy commanders broadcast promises to "flatten every coalition vehicle and leave no survivors." Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Eastern Maritime Raiders repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Our reconnaissance company operating in Gulf of Aden reports low‑lying fog, marginally reducing optical ISR. Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Human terrain teams note the civilian populace remains anxious but largely passive. Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." Signals analysis detected a 40 % surge in encrypted VHF traffic consistent with battalion rehearsals. Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death." Captured orders warn that any intruders near the bridge will be "blown to hell without mercy." Psych‑ops leaflets brand opposing fighters as "terrorist filth unworthy of mercy."
