Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Cyber analysts observed spear‑phishing attempts targeting the brigade logistics portal and neutralised them. Militia propaganda blared over loudspeakers calling coalition troops "spineless shit‑eaters who'll die in the mud." A crude poster threatens to "fuck up coalition rear echelons" using explicit sexual profanity. Enemy voice chat boasted, "We'll screw you so hard you'll beg for death."

Detainees revealed directives to "carpet‑bomb the entire damned town if NATO sets foot there." Intercepted audio captured an enemy squad leader yelling, "Move your fuckin' asses, you worthless bastards!" Over the last twenty‑four hours, elements of Black Viper Cartel repositioned artillery behind terrain‑masking ridges. Satellite SAR confirms a growing column of POL tankers along the main supply route. ISR drones observed fresh vehicle tracks leading into a suspected ammunition refill point. Friendly forces continue to fortify secondary battle positions and reinforce obstacles. Weather forecasts predict degraded visibility after 1900Z, limiting rotary‑wing sorties.
